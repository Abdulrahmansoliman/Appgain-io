# URL shortner
URL Shortener API
To run the backend server for the URL Shortener API, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Clone the project repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:


pip install -r requirements.txt

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the backend server by running the __init__.py file.

This will start the server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

You can now make requests to the API endpoints using a tool like cURL, Postman, or any programming language of your choice.

Note: Make sure to update the API endpoints in your requests to match the routes defined in routes/shortlinks.py file.
